GENAI LangChain – Prompt Engineering Mini Projects

This repository contains my learning journey of Prompt Engineering using LangChain, along with hands-on mini projects.
The main goal of this repo is to understand prompts deeply and build a strong GenAI foundation.

# What I Learned in This Repository

-> Basics of Prompt Engineering

-> How prompts control LLM behavior

-> How LangChain helps in structuring prompts

-> Using prompts in real mini projects

-> Difference between normal prompt vs structured prompt

🧩 Core Concepts Covered
1️. Prompt Engineering

Prompt Engineering means designing clear and effective instructions so that the AI gives accurate and useful output.

Example:

Explain Python in simple words for a beginner.

2️. Prompt Templates

Instead of writing prompts again and again, LangChain provides PromptTemplate.

✔ Reusable
✔ Clean
✔ Dynamic inputs

# Why use PromptTemplate?
-> Same format
-> Different inputs
-> Less error

3️. Dynamic Prompts
-> Using variables inside prompts.

Example use cases:

-> Role-based answers
-> Topic-based explanation
-> Level-based responses (Beginner / Advanced)

4️. Role-based Prompting
Telling AI who it should behave like.
Examples:
-> Act as a Teacher
-> Act as a Software Engineer
-> Act as an Interviewer

This improves clarity and accuracy of responses.

5. Output Control

Using prompts to:
-> Limit response length
-> Ask for step-by-step answers
-> Request bullet points

for examples

🛠 Mini Projects Included
🔹 Mini Project 1: Simple Prompt Demo

  -> AI behaves as a specific role
  -> Better domain-focused answers

🧪 Tech Stack Used
-> Python
-> LangChain
-> LLMs (OpenAI)
-> VS Code
